# Sunvault
This python program is the result of several iterative improvements and includes a picture of a solar panel in the main menu, significantly more information about solar energy, presented in a user- friendly form and a back button to return to the main menu. JavaScript web app inputs the area of a solar panel (m2), calculates and outputs estimated energy output (kWh) and cost savings (GBP) on a clear day and a cloudy day.
